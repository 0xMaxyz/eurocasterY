            Furthermore, OneFootball reserves the right to exclude participants
            from the sweepstakes for important reasons. An important reason
            exists, in particular, in the event of a violation of these
            participation terms and conditions, as well as in the case of
            completed or attempted manipulation of the contest, attempted
            disruption or influence on the proper course of the contest (e.g.,
            through the use of automatic scripts, hack tools, Trojans, or
            viruses). In these cases, winnings may be revoked even
            retrospectively. A case of manipulation that may lead to exclusion
            from the contest is particularly the collection or multiple
            participation (e.g., if a participant creates or uses multiple
            usernames to increase their chances of winning).

            Participation in the contest is only possible via the OneFootball
            web application and Farcaster (“Frames”) of OneFootball. To
            participate in the contest, participants must predict the outcome of
            at least 1 EURO 2024 football match during the contest period. For
            each football match in the group stage, the following response
            options are available: Which team will win: Team A / Draw / Team B.
            In the knockout stage, only the response options Team A or Team B
            are available.

            Participants start with 1 point (defined as “BALLS”) and predict the
            results of the respective current EURO 2024 games before the match
            officially starts. For a correct prediction of the match result,
            participants double their points. In the case of an incorrect
            prediction, all previously collected points are reset to 1.
            Participants collect their points over the entire contest period to
            move up and down on a “participant leaderboard.”

          <span className="c6">
            Users earn double points for correct predictions and have their points reset to one for incorrect predictions. To resolve ties among users with the same points, we use a tie-breaker based on the timeliness of correct predictions. We calculate the average time difference between each correct prediction and the match kickoff. Users with a higher average time difference, indicating they generally make their predictions sooner, are ranked higher. This ensures a fair and competitive ranking system.
